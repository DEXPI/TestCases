Some information shown in the equipment bar in E01V01.pptx cannot be represented with the DEXPI information model 1.2:

- Nominal diameter = 2.0 m is given for the entire tank.
  In DEXPI, tank does not have a nominal diameter attribute.
  Workaround in E01V02-VER.EX01.xml: Each of the chambers has an attribute nominal diameter = 2.0 m
  
- Nominal capacity = 220 m3 / 40 m3 is given for each chamber.
  In DEXPI, chamber does not have a nominal capacity attribute.
  Workaround in E01V02-VER.EX01.xml: The NominalCapacity(Volume) attribute of the tank is set to 260 m3 (220 + 40)
